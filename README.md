## Purpose

Our task this week was to build a professional portfolio using ReactJS and taking advantage of the curriculum objectives from this past week including React Router.

## Link to Deployed App



## Technologies Used  

ReactJS
TailwindCSS

## Notes for Graders  

There won't be many commits to this project. I was building my app on another repo with several commits but was unable to get everything with TailwindCSS to connect. I started working on a test app and was able to get it to work there. By the time I finished working on the app, I realized I had not created a new repo for the working app.
